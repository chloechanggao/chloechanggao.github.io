 This project is mainly aim for create a magical interaction between the user and the graphics on the screen, so the design of the balls created a space feeling in a way, thus when the user starts to play with the ball, it would create an illusion that he/she is interact with a space, not only the 2 dimensional ball graphics. Meanwhile the simple white and grey color would give a simple and future like atmosphere.
