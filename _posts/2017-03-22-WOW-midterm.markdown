What does the afterlife looks like has been widely discussed in different culture and philosophy. In both Eastern and Western culture, there is an idea of heaven and hell, and also, ghost. I have been wondering, is there a place for a “nice people”?  Nice people are neither good people nor bad people: they did not choose to be good or bad. 
The story is from a point of view of a new dead, who just entered the world of his afterlife. This is a world of “Nice People”, and the story is happening between all different “Nice Guy”. 

The reason why I choose glass to be the material of the world is because of its transparency, so everything will be exposed, no place to hide who you really are.

I'm still designing the entire settings and character cloth (Yes Todd, I'm gonna froze them longer ), another thing I want to try is to brought in the Tilt Brush SDK library into Unreal, so that it will have the drawing texture and movements.

I already successfully brought them into Unity for an AR project, and I also want to use them for the story narration for this class.
