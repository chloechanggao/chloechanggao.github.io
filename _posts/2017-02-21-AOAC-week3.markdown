This week me and Qiao start to work on the sketch mock up on our Fragment Time App. Here's the wireframe sketch:

And we have mock up 2 pages based on the sketch.

We use the url as the content for page three. But the format is not quite ideal. 
And we are still figuring it out by explore both Jquery format setting and also the javescript.

Right now there's a bug I can not fix, the work flow can only work once from page 2 to page 3, 
when I go back from page 3 to page 2, the on click did not work anymore.

For the location mapping I successfully located the location of Apple store on the simulator.
