The main goal for this project is to create magic feelings. Try to catch or reach something you can not get while still enjoy the process of approaching it. 


I have two ways that I want to explore :
First one is use screen and the kinect, create a sketch on the screen and detect the movement of userâ€™s hand and contour.

Second one is use Tango(or HoloLens) and Unity, Create AR elements, and guide the user to explore the entire space.
