This week we are using Unity and Vuforia to Experience the AR world. I am always fascinated with books ever since I was little, therefore I naturally start to wonder how to combine story together with the AR magic. Since I created a little Unity story last semester, I think it would be interesting if I can combine this animation story together with the real-book.

The Plot of the story is based on forest, so I choose a planet as the target pattern dataset.

The Plot of the story is based on forest, so I choose a planet as the target pattern dataset. 
And then I imported the animation to Unity and reorganize the movement of the elf character to make it more suitable for the setting of a book. After select the image target and active the dataset I imported the Camera Focus script, and the last thing is to see the magic pop book.
