For the final project I am planning to keep working with Tango, and create an immersive AR cinema experience together with my team member. Similar to the Blog Tango experience last week where the movements of the balls are followed a pre-designed pathway, there will be several pre-designed stories happen at different location.

Inspired by the immersive play Sleep No More,  our users will be able to choose different pathways go to different locations to see different plots. 


In this project, I’ll mainly in charge of study the Tilt Brush SDK Library to find an new and interesting way to narrate the story, combine real world and the virtual world to explore a different way to interact with viewers. 
For example, in the tilt brush SDK library, there’s a section about teleport and custom trigger, I’m planning to design a virtual element (such as blooming box) in a real-life environment, and then set it as the custom trigger to a virtual reality world. Meanwhile, there will be a custom trigger in the virtual reality world which can send the viewer back to reality world.

And the storyline is generated in both reality world and the virtual reality world :)
