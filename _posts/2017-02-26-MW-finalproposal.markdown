For the final project I'm planning to keep working with Tango, and create an immersive AR cinema together with my team member. In the Tango experience last week, the movements of the balls followed a pre-designed pathway. The interactive story we are going to create with tango is similar to this idea: there will be several pre-designed stories happen at different locations.

Similar to the immersive play Sleep No More, users have the rights to choose different pathways and go to different locations to see different plots. 


In this project, I’ll mainly in charge of studying the Tilt Brush SDK Library, to find an new interesting way to narrate the story and combine real world and the virtual world together to explore a different way to interact with viewers. 
For example, in the tilt brush SDK library, there’s a section about teleport and custom trigger, I’m planning to design a virtual element (such as blooming box) in a real-life environment, and then set it as the custom trigger to a virtual reality world. Meanwhile, there will be a custom trigger in the virtual reality world which can send viewers back to reality world.

And the storyline is generated in both reality world and the virtual reality world :)
