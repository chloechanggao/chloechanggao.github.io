For the final project I planning to keep working with Tango, and create an immersive AR cinema together with my team member. As in the Tango experience last week, the movements of the balls are followed a pre-designed pathway. The interactive story we gonna create with tango is similar to this idea: there will be several pre-designed stories happen at different location.

Similar to the immersive play Sleep No More, users have the right to choose different pathways go to different locations to see different plots. 


In this project, I’ll mainly in charge of study the Tilt Brush SDK Library to find an new and interesting way to narrative the story, combine real world and the virtual world to explore a different way to interact with viewers. 
For example, in the tilt brush SDK library, there’s a section about teleport and custom trigger, I’m planning to design a virtual element (such as blooming box) in a real-life environment, and then set it as the custom trigger to a virtual reality world. Meanwhile, there will be a custom trigger in the virtual reality world which can send the viewer back to reality world.

And the storyline is generated in both reality world and the virtual reality world :)
