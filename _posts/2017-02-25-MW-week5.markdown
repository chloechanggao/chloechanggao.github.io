This week we experienced Google Tango. I build the ball model from tilt brush and then imported them into unity, use them as objects.

The interaction of this project is straight and simple with the tango kitten library. Users can tab on any surface on the screen and then there will appear a cat.

The movements of the ball are designed within a pathway. And each ball has been assigned with different destination-point oder.

The kitten and the ball create a delightful interaction with each other and since it is what really happen in our everyday life, it’s easy to evoke users’ sympathy.
