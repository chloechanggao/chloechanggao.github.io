This week I started to play with the JQuery in Cordova to build the APP interface.

And JQuery is certainly convinience and simple in certain way.

For my own App I am still struggling between the ideas of build a super useful App or a supper useless App. 
I always want to build a TODO list App since all the current TODO list app in the market are way more complicated to use. But how to storage the data has been concerned me.
Here is a App I find very inspiring because of its simplicity and minimalism style:

This App is called Ricepo, It's an Asian food deliver App. Different from traditional food related Apps, it does not have any pictures, 
it only has the name of the food, and a ranking of popularity. I like to use it because it efficiently reduce the time I am spending on the App and get my food way more faster.
