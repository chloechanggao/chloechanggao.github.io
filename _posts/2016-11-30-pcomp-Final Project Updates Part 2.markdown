After giving it a thought how to distinguish whether it is a human being stand on the rug or not, I decided to use two small acrylic rug, and it will only activate the interaction when you put both of your feet on them.

Then I'm going to put two pressure sensor underneath the  acrylic, and when both of them pressed, it will activate the camera and start the interaction.
