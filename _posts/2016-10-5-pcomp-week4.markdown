During the lab this week, when I make the electrical piano the speaker did not work very well. I test the circuit with the LED light and the light works perfect, so i did not suspect the resistor. I was confused for a while tried different ways to connect the speaker to the breadboard, none of the methods worked. And then I changed the resistor for the first blue button,everything works fine. And then I realized that different components have different resist, it works for one does not means it works for all.  I thought it would be an interesting thing to share:D
