  <p>“Grown-ups love figures... 
  When you tell them you've made a new friend they never ask you any questions about essential matters. 
  They never say to you "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? " 
  Instead they demand "How old is he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? " 
  Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.” </p>
