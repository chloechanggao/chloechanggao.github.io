Ok, this project was a long story. The idea is to control (refresh the page, switch to the next page, etc) the P5 sketch through the ardriuno that burried in the book, by open and close the book

Me and my partner Rita tried to tested it with cable and switch, which only send "0" and "1", it works. High Five.

And then, the next step is try to control it through bluetooth, but still powered by the cable. it works. High Five x2.

So, the next step is go wireless, we stucked here for a while because of the battery and serveral hours later. it works. High Five x2.

And then, we changed the lovely switch to light sensor so that it can be controled with the , and things started to get tricky. Since both the sensor and battery is not stable enough it came to the result like this:
